## Usage

Uhh, it's static HTML. Look at the branch `gh-pages`. Or [browse it directly](https://benwiederhake.github.io/moar-emoji/)!

## TODOs

Things I should do eventually:
* Include Unicode 15 once it comes out
* Tell people about it
* Watch the world burn

## NOTDOs

Things I definitely don't wanna do:
* Making an interactive API
* Watch the world *actually* burn

## Contribute
